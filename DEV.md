My notes here.

Tasks (no order, choose between):
    -Style things better (medium)
    -Work on extending functionality for beatmap and multiplayer(medium)
    -Work on implementing enum reader for mod (medium)
    
    -Implement server-side try-catch on API and send back to client, learn how to process that (hard) 
     
Potential Future Improvements, if revisiting project:

    -Make website mobile-responsive
    -Consider adding chatGPT functionality, maybe to give extended summaries of players
    -Consider redoing this project with the updated osu!api-v2 and a better website design
